# guarding intellectual property with transparency

"trade secret" and "proprietary information" have become exploits to maximize individual laziness through [internal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm) theft

dont work for people who want to hide their actions from the public

dont work for people who want to insert themselves and their "brand" in front of the measure of your productivity

dont work for people who want to collect their title from a committee instead of having it set through the measure of their own actions

or you risk being exploited by what everyone else cant measure when "brand teamwork" is cited to steal credit for your work

for your own sake, your family, your shareholders, and the wealth of consumers, guard the origin and destination of your work by treating its measure as no different than the information produced from investing in research, or **intellectual property**

work for people who also want to have their personal actions measured, who work out in the open and develop their products publicly, who prefer public performance measurements over internal performance "reviews", and who do not exploit firm secrecy to usurp the role of religion

when paid time and secrecy are conveniently exploited by executives to talk about and enforce their own *culture* and *values*â€”that is, where firm owners expect leadership to be proven through **measurability** and **performance**, you become a party to the cult hosted at shareholder expense, and the consumers who are better served by more measurable and competitive work

practice your own religion

let its name be set by the measure of your actions

and we'll [let science sort us out](https://www.google.com/search?q=matthew+7+20&num=9)

as the cost of transmitting, storing and transforming information lowers, the cost of guarding intellectual property at the level of the firm is now greater for the economy than guarding it at the level of the market

"excuse me, but i dont report to you"

"you report to everyone now"
